# Predictive Analytics with Synthetic Data

Privacy-friendly, end‑to‑end ML workflows using **synthetic datasets**.  
This repo demonstrates how to generate data, build baselines, tune models, and evaluate results with clear, reproducible pipelines.

##  Highlights
- Synthetic data generation for classification/regression (no real PII).
- Clean preprocessing: splitting, scaling, encoding, class balancing (SMOTE).
- Baselines + ensembles: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
- Robust evaluation: cross‑validation, hold‑out test, metrics (accuracy, precision/recall, F1, ROC‑AUC), learning curves.
- Reproducible runs with fixed random seeds and saved artifacts.
